## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to make prediction on rotor temperature (pm) and find the best model among the other conducted models. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) is presented in the first section of the notebook to anaylise and summarise the characteristic of the variables and the relationship between the variables. Statistical graphics and data visualisation techniques will be used in the section. The second section of the notebook will be the development of regression model. The process in building the model will be presented in this section in detail. Each model will be compared with explaination and the best one will be selected. The models are:

* Least squared regression model,
* Ridge regression model,
* Lasso regression model,
* K-nearest Neighbours Regression Model (KNN), and
* Random forest model

Statistical assessments such as Adjusted R-squared and P-values will be used in the model specification process. Data provided for this assessment is `pmsm_temperature_data_A1_2021.csv`.
